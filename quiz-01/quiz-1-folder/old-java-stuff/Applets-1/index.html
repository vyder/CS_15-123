<p>
Before venturing into full blown Application GUIs it is best to
learn the fundamentals using Applets. Applets are simple, quick-n-dirty
containers for learning most of the GUI components. As simple as they are,
Applets provide a good foundation for learning the Swing component set,
interfaces, event handling and the container hierarchy. For all our examples
we will use the JApplet class rather than the older plain Applet class to
write our Applets. **If you are running a version of the JDK older than 1.4 you
should download the <a href="Applets.zip">Applets.zip</a> directory and compile all
the Applet source code with your version of the JDK on your own desktop.
</p>
The reasons for favoring JApplet over Applet are:
<ul>
  <li>the old Applet class lives in the AWT (Abstract Windows Toolkit) package.
  <li>old Applet can only contain old style AWT components which call upon the
      underlying platform's component set to draw controls etc.
  <li>JApplet relies on the new (JDK1.2 and newer) Swing component set which is
      not platform dependent (<i>almost</i> all of it anyway).
  <li>Swing components are improvements over the old AWT components.
</ul>

<h3>What is an Applet?</h3>
<p>An Applet is a Java program that executes under control of your browser and and thus
displays itself on an HTML page.  To execute an applet inside an HTML page you follow these easy steps
</p>


<ul>
<li>write an Java Applet program and compile it on the server or your PC
<table bgcolor="silver"><tr><td><pre>
import javax.swing.*;     // access to all the swing components widgets, dialogs etc.
import java.awt.Graphics; // access to the Graphics object (circles, lines, graphics)
public class JApplet0 extends JApplet
{
  public void paint( Graphics g )  // override inherited paint method
  {
     g.drawString(&quot;Saying 'Hello' at x=100  y=200&quot;,100,200 );
  }
}</pre></td></tr></table>

  <li>write an HTML page that 'tags' that applet: <a href="JApplet0.html" target='external'>JApplet0.html</a>
  <li>Load that HTML page to cause your browser to load and execute the Applet


<p>
If we view source on the Applet0.html page we just loaded we see the Applet tag syntax
that causes the client's browser to load the Applet into the HTML page. Note also that
the Applet is displayed much like an image. When an image is loaded the browser looks
at the image tag to see what size of a rectangle the HTML programmer wants assigned to that
image. Likewise the applet tag allows the HTML programmer to specify the rectangle
size
in which the Applet is to execute and display itself. Our applet tag in Applet0.html
specified that
Applet0 run in a 400 x 400 window. Where that window appears on the HTML page depends on
the usual factors such as what other text or graphics has been already displayed on the HTML page.
</p>
<p>
Since our Applet was given a 400 X 400 pixel window on the HTML page, a coordinate system
is automatically defined over that window. The coordinates are (0,0) starting at the upper
left corner of the Applet rectangle and extending to (400,400) at the lower right corner.
Note that out the first character of Hello World appears at x=50 y=200. To be precise it
is the lower left corner of the first font character that is rooted at (50,200) in the Applet
coordinate system. This can be easily verified by changing the drawString y coordinate to 0
and then observe that the text disappears except for the chars that have pieces falling below the
baseline.
</p>

<h3>Other kinds of things can you can place on an Applet</h3>
<p>Applets allow you to place 3 categories of visible objects on it:
<ul>
  <li>text: i.e. "Hello World" etc.
  <li>graphics: i.e. circles, lines, rectangles, panels, 3D shapes etc.
  <li>controls: i.e. buttons, labels, textboxes, scrollbars, sliders, checkboxes etc.
</ul>
<p>
As we will see in later lessons, layout managers and layout containers such as
Panels are used for grouping and presentation control. Our next Applet will
demonstrate text and graphics. In doing so we illustrate the basic coordinate
system of an Applet.

<h3>Ok. pop quiz: What caused the problem? How can we fix it?</h3>
<hr>
<h2 align='center'>Putting active components on an Applet</h2>
<p>
So far we have demonstrated that we can draw text and graphics
directly on an Applet via the Graphics object through methods such as
<i>drawString()</i>, <i>drawOval()</i>, <i>drawLine()</i>, etc. Since GUIs are
all about interaction with a user the next logical step is putting interactive
components (controls or widgets) on our Applet. Most of those components recognize
being clicked or slected or typed into etc. Such user actions taken on these widget
produce <b>events</b>. The programmer must provide code that defines how the each
widget is to respond to these events.
</p>
<p>Since we are using JApplet exclusively we now begin our survey of the various
kinds of Swing components that can be placed on a JApplet. For each component in
the Swing component set - there is an associated event handling mechanism. That
mechanism is an interface, and where there are interfaces there are methods that
must be overridden by the programmer to define the specific behavior or "reaction"
of a widget to an event on that widget.
</p>
<p>
There mapping from components to event handling interfaces is many to one.
Each event handing interface usually handles more than one component. Besides
giving a programmer interfaces for programming events, Swing provides Layout
Managers and grouping containers to allow control over how widgets are positioned,
grouped and displayed on the Applet or Application.
</p>
<p>
We start with a simple JApplet with some JButtons. This JApplet uses FlowLayout,
the simplest of all to determine placement of the JButtons. This JApplet also
implements ActionListener, an interface whose <i>actionPerformed()</i> method must
be overridden to define each JButton's response to it's click event.

<h3><a name="syncAsync">Synchronous vs. Asynchronous programming</a></h3>
<p>Before going on it should be noted that a GUI is either executing some code
behind the interface or it is waiting for the next event. The implications are
that if the code associated with an event takes a long time to complete, the
GUI will not respond to the next event until that code completes and  control
is sent back to the GUI interface. To illustrate this you can perform a simple
experiment. In the code for one of our colored buttons, add a loop that spins
2 billion times and put that loop just before the line to change the color.
As soon as you click that button, try to click other buttons on the interface.
The interface will not respond until the event currently executing is handled
and control returns back to the surface of the GUI. The OS will however cache
those ignored keystrokes and process them when control returns to the surface
of the GUI</p>
<p>
There is of course a way around this strict serial execution. The use of threads
to fork some handler code out to it's own process will circumvent this. Threads
however introduce new issues such as thread safe-ness and synchronization. This
additional overhead is often worth it so that your GUI stays responsive. You never
want your GUI to appear to lock up because some handler code just started executing
some time consuming code.
</p>
<p>Most GUIs do fine without threads because the handler code is usually trivial or
fast. It's only when the handlers take a long time to execute that threads become
useful in GUIs.
</p>
<h3><a name="panelGrid">More widgets and their interfaces</a></h3>
<p>Our next JApplet introduces more Swing widgets, JPanel and  another Layout
Manager to control grouping, size and appearance of the widgets. This JApplet
again impliments the ActionListener interface to handle it's events.
