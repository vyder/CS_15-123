/*
	Exercise2.java  input validation

	This program prompts the user for a lower bound and an upper bound.  You must put these prompts in
	a loop that repeats until the following is true:
		- both numbers are greater than 0
		- lower is strictly less than the upper

	After the lower and upper are validated, echo out a line of output displaying the lower and the upper
