	Exercise4.java  Nested loops and ifs to find prime numbers

	This program prompts the user for a lower bound and an upper bound.  You may assume the lower 
	is less than the upper and that both are positive. Be careful not to enter data that violates this
	or your program will be fubar.

	After the lower and upper are entered write another loop that finds all the prime numbers between
	lower and upper inclusive.

	A prime number is one which does not divide evenly with any number except 1 and itself.  A brute force
	way to find if a number is prime is to divide it by 2,3,4,5 .. up to number/2 and if none of the remainders
	are 0, you have a prime number. If at any time you get a non-zero remainder, your number is NOT prime.

	You must do the above for every number between lower and upper inclusive and print only those that pass
	the prime test.

	Here is the pseudo code for testing a number for prime:

	divisor = 2
	do
		remainder = number % divisor
		if remainder not 0 then
			increment divisor
	while (divisor <= half the number  AND  remainder is not zero )

	if remainder is not zero, the number is prime - print it out
