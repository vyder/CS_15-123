/* 
	Exercise1.java  

	This program runs a loop that repeatedly prompts the user for positive numbers. Each number
	is examined to be odd or even then added to the oddSum or evenSum accordingly. If the nuymber 
	is negative, then don't add it to anything becasue that is the user's signal to quit.

	You must declare variables, fill in some of the code and replace descriptive comments with 
	code to accomplish what the comments describe to be done
