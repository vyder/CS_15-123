	Solution1.java

	This program generates the reversal of a String by pulling off the last character and tacking
	it onto a String that is inititally null.

	*Hint: every time you pull off the last char of the original string - you will actually
	be creating a new String in its place that has one less char.

	The original string is thus reduced to nothing by the end of the loop. We did not need to
	reduce the String each time to create a reversal but it is good exercise with substring method
