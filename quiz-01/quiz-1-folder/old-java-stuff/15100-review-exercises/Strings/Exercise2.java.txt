/*
	Exercise2.java  character shift within a string

	This program is similar to exercise 1 but instead of generating a reversal it instead does 
	shirfting of the characters.

	Examples: 
		"Hello"   shifted 1  place   becomes  "oHell"
		"Hello"   shifted 3  places  becomes  "lloHe"
		"FooBar"  shifted -1 places  becomes  "ooBarF"
		"FooBar"  shifted -3 places  becomes  "BarFoo"

	Note that in a fwd shift the end chars wrap to the back
	and a rev shift the front chars wrap to the front.
	No chars are ever lost.

	*Hint: every time you shift chars 1 place, you are actually be creating a 
	new String in its place that has the back char moved to the front or front
	char moved to the back. Thus the original string is destroyed
