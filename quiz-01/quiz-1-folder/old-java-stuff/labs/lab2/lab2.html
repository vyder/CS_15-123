<h4>Background:</h4>
<p>This lab is a re-make of Lab1. The main tester program I will use is the same one I used to test your Leb1. You should
rename it to Lab2 and reuse if for testing of our Lab2 version of your Graph class.


<p>The Graph class is where you will make changes.&nbsp; You will store your
graph in an array g[] of Edge pointers.&nbsp; An Edge object is just a small
class that holds a destination node #, a weight value, and a pointer to the next
Edge.&nbsp; In your Graph class you will replace your int g[][] with Edge
g[].&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Each element of g[] will be a pointer to an Edge object. Thus each
element of g[] is the head of a linked list. Each linked list headed by
g[i] represents a list of edges leaving node i.
</p>

<p>Because the edge information is stored in linked lists, the implementation of
the graph's Constructor, readGraphFile, AddEdge(), inDegree() and
outDegree() and print() will change.&nbsp; When rewriting the Graph methods that
are changing - you should refer to the Linked List demo code given in class.
</p>


<font size=-1>

<p>All the public degree methods methods in Graph.java (<b>the ones called from main</b>)  will not change for Lab2
. They will work <b>exactly</b> as written in Lab1.
</p>

<h4>What You'll Need</h4>

<p>Download the <a href="Lab2.zip"><big>Lab2.zip</big></a> file to your
 temp directory and unzip the files. You should see the
following files:
<ul>
	<li>(folder) starter-files
	<ul>
		<li> Graph.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          // you finish this shell and hand it in&nbsp;
		<li> Edge.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          // you finish this shell and hand it in&nbsp;
	</ul>
</ul>
<hr size="5">
<h4>Assignment</h4>
You are to re-implement the private member functions in Graph.java. The 6
public min max methods (and private degree ) remain the same.
<p>
For our input file, graphdata.txt, <b>the correct answers are: (THE SAME AS LAB 1):</b>
<ul>
  <li>Max Out Degree - <b>3</b>
  <li>Min Out Degree - <b>1</b>
  <li>Max In Degree - <b>4</b>
  <li>Min In Degree - <b>0</b>
  <li>Max Degree - <b>5</b>
  <li>Min Degree - <b>2</b></li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4>Handing in your Solution</h4>
Your solution should be in the form of a <b> .zip file</b>. <b>It should contain  only the following files</b>:
<ul>
	<li>Graph.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      // YOUR solution file  with your <b>modified</b>&nbsp; methods&nbsp;
	<li>Edge.java&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</ul>
