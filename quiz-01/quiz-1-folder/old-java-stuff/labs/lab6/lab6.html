<h4>Background:</h4>

<p>Lab6 is an enhancement of the RacingBalls applet. We enhance our Applet by adding threading to replace the
hardcoded delay loop. We also use a JSlider control to allow the user to adjust the speed at which the balls
advance across the screen.

<h4>The Assignment</h4>

<h4>You are given no starter files other than what you can find on our course website</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Applet must have 3 buttons Reset, Start & Clear.
	<li>Balls must be Red Green and Blue
	<li>Balls must start at 2/5, 3/5, 4/5 down the left side of the applet.
	<li>Balls must be 50 pixels in diameter.
	<li>You must erase the previous position of the ball - no blur across screen.
	<li>Threading must be used to control the speed of the balls
	<li>JScrollBar as demoed in todays lecture notes (or JSlider - see API) control must be present to allow user to change ball speed <b>while balls are racing</b>.
	<li>The minimum delay is 1 millisecond, the max is 1 second.
	<li>You must turn in TWO source files - a JApplet named ThreadedRace.java and a .html file for it.
</ul>
