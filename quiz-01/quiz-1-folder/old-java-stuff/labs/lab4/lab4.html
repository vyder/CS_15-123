<h1 align="center">Lab4: Binary Search Trees - Part II</h1>

<hr color="green" size="5">
<h3>Due Date: 2 Mar 2006  by 11:59pm</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Background:</h3>
Lab4 will rewquire you to implement the last of the operations we discussed in class this week.
The level order traversal (and pretty print if you try it) will require the use of a Queue.
You are to write your own Queue class based on the Priority Queue Lab you did. Remember
that a Queue is just a simpler version of a Priority Queue. A plain Queue just does insert
at end instead of insertInOrder. Lab4 uses a plain Queue and each list element will store a Node pointer.

<h3>The Assignment: </h3>
<p>Lab4 requires you fill in al the methods in the BST class definition
file.&nbsp; We will discuss esch of these methods in class.</p>
<h3>Here is the main tester program <a href="Lab4.java">Lab4.java</a> It is your job to examine the calls
in the main and reverse engineer the code you need to put into the Tree.java file to satisfy all those calls</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Copy Constructor:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Tree t2 = new Tree( t1 );&nbsp;&nbsp; // where t1 is already built
	<li>levelOrderPrint() - Prints node strings in level order.
	<li>remove() - Prompt user for a string to delete from the tree.
      you must confirm that it was either deleted or not found
    <li>isEqual() -  a boolean method that satisfies syntax :  if (t2.isEqual(t1)) { print they are equal etc }
    <li>prettyPrint( t1 ): I will post a sample output of this over the weekend.
        Only do this for X/Credit after all other methods are working
</ul>

<h3>Handing in your Solution</h3>
<p>
Your solution should be in the form of a.ZIP file.<b> Zip and hand-in:
<ul>
	<li>Tree.java
	<li>Node.java
	<li>Queue.java
	<li>ListElement.java
</ul> </b>Don't hand in&nbsp; input files or .class files.&nbsp;
<p>Use <a href="http://handin.intro.cs.cmu.edu"><font size=+2><b>Handin</b></font></a>
to submit your ZIP file
