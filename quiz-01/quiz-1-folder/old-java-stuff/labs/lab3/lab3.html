<h1 align="center">Lab3: Binary Search Trees</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Due Date: Thu 23 Feb 2006 by 11:59pm</h3>
<hr>
<h3>Background:</h3>
Lab 3 requires you read a file of wrods into a Binary Search Tree (BST).
Once it is read in we call several member methods of the Tree class to print
 out the tree's statistics such as # nodes, leaves, levels etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 You are also required to do print traversals, searches, insertions and counting
of nodes.
<p>
Do not modify any  files except Tree.java. When you hand in your solution just hand in one file
"Tree.java" and do not hand in ANY other files.</p>

<h3>You must fill in the following methods in the Tree.java starter file so that ALL the method calls in Lab3.java
call on methods that have been filled in. Notice that every public method is called from main and it hasd a private
helper method that is called by the public method because the public method does not have access to root.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>1% public void preOrderPrint()
	<li>1% private void preOrderPrintHelper( Node root )
	<li>1% public void postOrderPrint()
	<li>1% private void postOrderPrintHelper( Node root )
	<li>15% private int countNodesHelper( Node root)
	<li>15% private int countLeavesHelper(Node root)
	<li>15% private int depthHelper( Node root )
	<li>15% private boolean searchHelper( Node root, String data )
	<li>36% private void calcLevelCounts( Node root, int[] levelCounts, int level )
</ul>

<h2>Starter code, input files and correct output listings</h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="starter-code.zip">starter-code.zip</a> Just add input files and you are ready to compile and run!
	The Tree.java file is not completely filled out. Fill in and test one method at a time. Compare your output to the
	correct output listings provided.
	<li> <a href="input-files.zip">input-files.zip</a> a tiny 20 word file and a huge scrabbvle dictionary file. You
	should draw the BST that is produced by this input and make sure that your numbers agree with my output numbers and that
	both of ours make sense to you.
	<li> <a href="20-words-output.txt">Correct Output</a> for the tiny  20-words.txt file
	<li> <a href="scrabble-output.txt">Correct Output</a> for the huge scrabble.txt file
</ul>
<h2>WARNING: Your completed Tree.java MUST compile and execute with the GIVEN starter-code. Do not modify the other files
to get your Tree.java to work.</h2>
<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Handing in your Solution</h3>
<p>
Your solution should be just<b> one single unzipped file:&nbsp;&nbsp; Tree.java&nbsp;</b>
</p>
<p>Use the Intro Programming drop-off form to
<a href="https://handin.intro.cs.cmu.edu"><b>Submit</b></a> your zip file
