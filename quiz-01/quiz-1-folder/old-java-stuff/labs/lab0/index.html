<h1 align="center">Lab 0: Reverse engineering a class</h1>
<hr>

<p>
	The purpose of this assignment is to measure your competency with class design. You are given a main program
	that declares an instance of the Coin class. The coin class is not from the the API. It is something I wrote.
	The main program then exercises that class by making various calls to its  methods.  You are shown the output
	produced by the program and asked to write the source code for the Coin class.  You will do so by noting the names
	of the methods called, the data type those methods return and the behaviour of the program.  Thus - you must reverse
	engineer the Coin class and write the source code for Coin.java.
</p>

<p>
	Be sure to name and prototype all your class members correctly. If you observe the main program you
	can deduce precisely their names and prototypes.
</p>

<p>
	Note that when a coin object is created, it's internal head and tail counts are initialized to zero.
	Each time a coin is <b>.flip()</b>'d that flip increments that coin's heads or tails counts with
	a 50% each probability. Thus, you must use a Random variable inside your Coin class to get a 50/50
	chance of getting a head or tail. Once the flip method decided that a head or tail was rolled,
	the flip method increments the appropriate counter and then returns the String "H" or "T".
	The reset() method starts that coin's H/T counters back at 0.

<h4>Here is the output of a <b>sample run</b> of CoinTester.java</h4>
<p>
I did NOT seed the Random object in my Coin.java class definition file. As a result, <b>this program
and yours will give slightly different results every time</b>. Over the long run though, you should see about equal
numbers of heads an tails.
