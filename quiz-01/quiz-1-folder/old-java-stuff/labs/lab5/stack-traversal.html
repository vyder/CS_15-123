<h1 align="center">Graph Traversals - escaping a maze</h1>
<hr>

<pre>
The maze we are escaping from will be represented by a square grid of 1s and 0s. The 1s represent
a step on a path and the 0s represent a wall. Lab5 is an example of such a representation where the
grid is a swamp. The 1s are solid ground and the 0s are quicksand. For this illustration we assume
a square grid (the swamp) and the coordinates of the initial starting point. Our task is to discover
and print all the paths out of the swamp from our origin within.

Here is our (maze) swamp

      0 1 2 3 4
     ----------
  0 : 0 0 1 0 1
  1 : 0 1 0 1 0
  2 : 0 0 1 1 0
  3 : 0 1 0 1 0
  4 : 0 1 0 0 1

The input file for this swamp would look like this:

5 2 2
0 0 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 1

The first line contains a 5 to represent the square dimension of the grid - 5x5. The 2 and 2
represent the starting coordinate where me must escape from. row 2 column 2.

Here is some psuedo code that illustrates the algorithm we will employ to find and print all the paths
out of the swamp from our point of origin.

We start at origin (2,2)

Our algorithm will use a single stack to record each path we take through the grid. Our first operation is to PUSH the origin (2,2) onto the stack.

STACK:
[2][2] &lt;-- stack_top

We now begin our orderly search from our current origin (top of stack) for a neighbor with a 1.
Of course our search always begins with a base case test. Is the coordinate on the top of the stack
and escape step (i.e. at the edge of the grid). If not we then begin an orderly scan of our neighbors.
Our search ordering is arbitrary so we will examine our neighbors in the following order
(clockwise starting North) N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW. We only PUSH a neighbor on top the stack if
the neighbor is a "1" and the neighbor is not already in the stack. This second condition avoids cycles.

PUSH NE [1][3] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH NE [0][4] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] [0][4] &lt;-- stack_top  (ESCAPED ! - PRINT/POP/RETURN)

We have a solution. [0][4] is on the edge of the grid so we reverse print the stack and <b>POP</b> back to [1][3]
then  return from our recursion to resume our clockwise scan with our E neighbor

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH S [2][3] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] [2][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH S [3][3] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] [2][3] [3][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH SE [4][4] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] [2][3] [3][3] [4][4] &lt;-- stack_top (ESCAPED! - PRINT/POP/RETURN)

We have a solution. [0][4] is on the edge of the grid so we reverse print the stack and POP back to [3][3]
then return from our recursion to resume our clockwise scan with our S neighbor

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] [2][3] [3][3] &lt;-- stack_top

Since we have no other eligible neighbors around [3][3] we POP back to [2][3]
then return from our recursive call to resume our clockwise scan with our SW neighbor.

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] [2][3] &lt;-- stack_top

Since we have no other eligible neighbors around [2][3] we POP back to [1][3]
then return from our recursion to resume our clockwise scan with our SW neighbor

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH NW [0][2]  followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] [0][2] &lt;-- stack_top (ESCAPED! - PRINT/POP/RETURN)

We have a solution. [0][2]is on the edge of the grid so we reverse print the stack,
pop back to [1][3] then return from our recursion to resume our clockwise scan

STACK:
[2][2] [1][3] &lt;-- stack_top

Since there are no more neighbors to scan from this origin we POP back to [2][2]
then return from our recursion to resume our clockwise scan with our E neighbor

STACK:
[2][2] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH E [2][3] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [2][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH N [1][3] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [2][3] [1][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH NW [0][4] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [2][3] [1][3] &lt;-- stack_top

We have a solution. [0][4] is on the edge of the grid so we reverse print the stack and POP back to [1][3]
then from our recursion to and resume our clockwise scan with our E neighbor.

STACK:
[2][2] [2][3] [1][3] &lt;-- stack_top

Since we have no other eligible neighbors around [3][3] we POP back to [2][3]
then return from our recursive call to resume our clockwise scan with our NE neighbor

STACK:
[2][2] [2][3] &lt;-- stack_top

PUSH S [3][3] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [2][3] [3][3] &lt;-- stack_top


PUSH SW [4][4] followed by a recursive call (top is now our curr origin)

STACK:
[2][2] [2][3] [3][3] [4][4] &lt;-- stack_top
We have a solution. [4][4] is on the edge of the grid so we reverse print the stack and POP back to [3][3]
then from our recursion to and resume our clockwise scan with our S neighbor.
