<h4>Background:</h4>

<p>Lab5 is a warm-up for a more interesting problem coming next. Lab5 requires you to
apply what you know about 2D arrays, recursion and/or lists, stacks queues to find your
way out of a swamp.

The swamp is a 2D array of ones and zeros. Each "1" is a step of solid ground,
while each "0" is a step of quicksand. Each input file will have a line at the top
of the file that has the square dimensions of the matrix followed by the drop point.
The drop point is the row/col pair indicating where you are dropped into the swamp.
You escape the swamp by taking one step at a time to any adjacent square that is
a 1. You are not allowed to step on Quicksand (a zero). You must somehow remember
which squares you have already stepped on in a path so that you don't get into
an infinite loop.
</p>
<h4>Here is an example of an input file that represents a swamp having multiple escape
paths and some cycles. An escape path is a path from the drop point to the edge of the swamp.</h4>

<pre><font size=+2>
10 2 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <b>1</b> 0
0 0 <b>1</b> 0 0 0 <b>1</b> <b>1</b> 0 0
0 <b>1</b> 0 <b>1</b> 0 <b>1</b> 0 0 0 <b>1</b>

</font></pre>
<p>
The first row has 3 values:
<ul>
	<li>10 - the matrix is 10 x 10
	<li>2 1 - you are dropped into the swamp at row 2 col 1
</ul>
The next 10 rows represent the square stepping stones or quicksand of the swamp.
You may make 1 step in any direction to find your way out of the swamp.

<h4>What You'll Need</h4>

<h4>Here are your input files and <b><i>sample</i></b> correct outputs: (I may add some more by the weekend)</h4>
<ul>
	<li><a href="swamp1.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp1.txt</font></a> one path out - no cycles
	<li><a href="swamp1-sample-correct-output.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp1-sample-correct-output.txt</font></a>
	<li>
	<li><a href="swamp2.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp2.txt</font></a> 2 paths out - no cycles
	<li><a href="swamp2-sample-correct-output.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp2-sample-correct-output.txt</font></a>
	<li>
	<li><a href="swamp3.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp3.txt</font></a> 50 paths out - many cycles
	<li><a href="swamp3-sample-correct-output.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp3-sample-correct-output.txt</font></a>
	<li>
	<li><a href="swamp4.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp4.txt</font></a> many cycles - no path out
	<li><a href="swamp4-sample-correct-output.txt" target="external"><font size=+1>swamp4-sample-correct-output.txt</font></a>
</ul>

<h4>These sample outputs are only representative of the format you must print out. The order of the escape paths and the
wording/format need not be identical but:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>You must echo the swamp file and point of origin
	<li>You must print out every escape path on its own line
	<li>You must report the exact number of escape paths found and it must match the number reported by the sample output.
	<li>Your paths may appear in a different order than but there must be a 1-1 mapping of identical paths from your solution to mine.
</ol>

<h4>The Assignment</h4>

<h4>You are given no starter files and you must write the entire program from scratch.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>It must take the input file on the command line.
	<li>You must try catch ALL exceptions in your code.
	<li>The clause "throws Exception" must not appear ANYWHERE in any of your code.
	<li>An escape path is a sequence of moves from the drop point to the edge of the swamp.
    <li>Your program must find and print <b>ALL</b> the escape paths - each on its own line.
	<li>DO NOT PRINT ANY DEAD END STEP YOU TAKE - ONLY THE SUCCESSFUL PATHS OUT!
	<li>If there are no escape paths you must print a message something like: "DEAD END SWAMP! NO PATH OUT".
	<li>You must report the exact number of escape paths found. That number must of course match the number of paths printed.
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>100% credit if you solve using extra data structures
	<li>120% credit if you solve using recursion only
</ul>

<h2>You may solve it any way you want.</h2>

Use recursion, iteration, a stack, a queue, hybrid data structure and you may use that
data structure any way you wish. Also you may use any of the built in Java data structures
in the java util package. You given <b>no starter files</b> and you must write the entire program from scratch.

<p>
I suggest you write a method to read and echo the input file first.
Verify its correctness before searching for escape paths
