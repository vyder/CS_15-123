BOGGLE&nbsp; via Recursion &amp; Backtracking + Pruning Heuristic&nbsp;
</font><br>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Lab 7 is our next encounter with backtracking ans recursion (like the swamp).  You will have 2
weeks to write it. You will use the BST class. Recall that backtracking is a technique whereby
an algorithm recognizes it is impossible or unnecessary to search any deeper into the search space
from a given point. An example of this is finding your way through a maze.
When you hit a dead end you mark that path as a dead end and don't go down that
path any more.&nbsp;<p>You will solve a problem that would be impossible to
solve without a good heuristic to abandon dead ends and save vast amounts
of wasted searches (and thus vast amounts of time).<h3>The game of Boggle:</h3>
<p>The game of Boggle is a board game that uses 16 dice arranged in a 4 x 4
grid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each dice is 6 sided and each side contains a letter of the
alphabet.&nbsp; Occasionally the string &quot;Qu&quot; will appear on a dice
face.&nbsp;&nbsp; A typical board will look like this.
</p>

<p>
 A typical Boggle game usually starts by shaking the dice on the board thus
 creating a new grid of letters on the game board. The object of the game is
 for each player to form as many valid dictionary words as possible by connecting
 adjacent letters in any direction without any cycles.&nbsp; Think of how a
 King can mode an a chessboard - across, up ,down or diagonal.&nbsp; You can generate words by
connecting letters in any direction as long as you don't create cycles.&nbsp;
Thus in a 4x4 grid you could form words a long as 16 characters (well.. 17 if
you hit a &quot;Qu&quot; dice).
</p>
<p>You will be surprised at home many unique strings&nbsp; you can generate from
even a 2 x 2 grid.&nbsp;&nbsp; A 2 x 2 grid can generate 64 unique
strings.&nbsp; A 3 x 3 can generate over 10,000 and a 4 x 4 c generates&nbsp;
several million. A 5 x 5 generates trillions and&nbsp; larger grids are
astronomical. There is no closed from expression to calculate the number of
string that can be formed from an N x N grid.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way to
calculate that number is to actually generate all those strings with a program
and count them as you form them.
</p>
<h3>A Heuristic:</h3>
<p>In order to avoid forming all possible strings to find the good
(dictionary)&nbsp; ones, you will need to use a heuristic to prune the search
space.&nbsp; You must recognize that in many cases (the vast majority, in fact)
you should not bother forming new words that start with a word you have already
searched for but failed to find.&nbsp; The heuristic works like this:</p>
<p>Every time you form a word from letters in the grid, you will search the
dictionary for that word.&nbsp; Your search method (from the Tree class) will be
modified such that every time it compares the search word to the ones in the
dictionary, it will remember if that word was a pre-fix of any dictionary words
it encountered in the search.&nbsp; If the search comes back false (not found)
then this prefix (true/false) flag becomes meaningful.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a word was
just searched for, but not found, AND it was <b>not</b> a prefix of any word it
encountered in the dictionary, then we can conclude that no word we might ever
form based on that word would ever be in the dictionary.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>Suppose we search for the word </font><font size="4">&quot;grt&quot;</font>
<font size=-1>
 and the search returns false.&nbsp; Furthermore assume that at no time during the
search , did our search word match as a prefix of any of the words compared
to.&nbsp; The prefix flag for that search will be set to false. This means we
should not form any more strings from the grid that begin with this search word.
Why?&nbsp; Because our prefix flag foretells us that we won't find any words in the dictionary
that start with that search word - so why form and search them ?</font></p>
<p><font size=-1>If you implement the heuristic correctly your
program will solve any size grid (even 30x30 or more ) in very short time ( less
than a second as opposed to days or centuries!)&nbsp; because the vast majority of the
possible strings are not prefixes of valid words and thus most of the search space is pruned
out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidentally this heuristic is &quot;lossless&quot;. It
is the definitive heuristic for this problem . It&nbsp; never prunes searches that could have yielded valid
words, yet prunes a huge majority or useless searches.</p>

<h3>What You'll Need</h3>

<p>Download the <a href="lab7.zip"><font size=+1>Lab7.zip</font></a>&nbsp;file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see the following files:
<ul>
	<li><b>Demo</b> folder:&nbsp; contains a demo program that lists all the
      strings possible from a boggle board
	<li><b>Solution-exe</b> folder : contains executable for the finished
      program. You final solution should behave like it.
	<li>several&nbsp; input (.txt) files containing a grid of letters to
      represent Boggle board states.
</ul>

<hr size="5">
<h3>Assignment</h3>



<p>First Step: Write a program that does what the demo program does -
just prints out all possible strings. Once you have this done you have accomplished the hard part.


<p>Once your starter code can generate all possible strings like the Demo
program, Your remaining task is to enhance that program in 3 significant ways
to reach the final solution:<p><b>First:&nbsp;&nbsp;
You will add 2 (TWO) BSTs to the Boggle class</b>. The first will be the dictionary (&quot;scrabble.txt&quot; again).&nbsp;
The second tree will hold all the words from the grid that were also found in
the Dictionary.&nbsp;&nbsp; The game of Boggle is the game of searching thru a 4Nx
N grid of letters and finding as many legal dictionary words in it as
possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><b>Second: You must modify the Tree class:</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;
You must add a boolean data member to your tree class. Call it <b>&quot;prefix&quot;.&nbsp;
</b>You must set it to FALSE before each word search.&nbsp; Inside your <b>searchHelper()&nbsp;
</b>you must compare the search word to every word in the dictionary and see if
that search word is a prefix of the dictionary word.&nbsp; If it you ever
encounter a comparison where the search word IS a prefix of the dictionary word
being compared to then you set your prefix true and leave it true for the rest
of the search.<p><b>Third:</b> <b> You will add some code to the solveHelper
method</b>. The code you add to the solveHelper will be the pruning heuristic
described above.&nbsp; The code that you add will examine the prefix flag after
every search. If the search failed and the prefix was also false then you should
not recurse deeper into the grid and thus not form any new words based on the
current search word.&nbsp;<p>Lastly you will modify your Tree class'
inOrderPrint() method to print the words on lines no more than 60 chars long.
See my solution.<p>&nbsp;

<h4>Sample Output:</h4>

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the Demo program to understand the correct word generation
patterns.&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then run the solution exe to see the how it performs with
the dictionary and heuristic added.&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>Handing in your Solution</h4>

Your solution should be in the form of a .zip file.&nbsp;

<p><b>Your Solution zip file should contain all your source files </b><br>
Also you must handin a readme.txt file that explains how to run your oprogram - command args etc.<br>
You must have a paragraph in that readme file that gives your best estimate of a formula that computes
the number of possible strings you can form from an n X n grid</p>
In other words give me some equation like:
<pre>
for any N x N grid of letters you can form this many possible  words:

possibleWords = 2 ^ N^N ( 2 to the power  N to the N)    ...  or something like that.
</pre>
