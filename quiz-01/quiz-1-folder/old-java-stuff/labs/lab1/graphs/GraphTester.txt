// trivial little program that declares a Graph object
// and tests out its C'tor and print method

// When you write your Lab 2 you will get the filename from the command line
// and you will put try/catches in the readGraphFile so that you can remove ALL
// the throws IOException clauses after our methods. But first I will explain
// to you how to do this corrctly.
//
// You will add several new methods to the Graph class and to your GraphTester program
// such as inDegree outDegree etc etc..
import java.io.*;
class GraphTester
{
   
    public static void main( String args[] ) throws IOException // since Graph class doesn't handle them
    {
         Graph myGraph = new Graph( "graphdata.txt" );
         myGraph.print();
    }
