<h1>Weighted, Directed Graphs & Adjacency Matrices</h1>
<hr color="green">

A graph may be thought of as a set of nodes and edges. Many authors call the nodes vertices.
For our purposes the terms are interchangeable and we will use nodes because it's shorter.
In a weighted, directed graph, the nodes and the edges may carry a label or some information.
Often the nodes will carry a label and the edges will carry a value (<b><i>weight</i></b> or cost).<br>
In a directed graph an edge has <b><i>direction</i></b>. It goes <b>from</b>
one node <b>to</b> another node.<br><br> In the graph example below, the weighted edges
(representing distance)
go from one city to another city. The edges have <b><i>direction</i></b><br><br>

<img align="center" src="weightedgraph1.jpg" >
<br><br>
<p>Such a graph <i><b>G</b></i> can be represented via an <b>adjacency matrix</b>. In such a matrix
the row and column names are the names of the nodes.  The value at each G[row][col]
position represent the cost or weight of the edge between the two nodes.
If there is no edge between two nodes then an impossibly large value such as
infinity ( oo ) or a large constant is stored to represent the fact that
no edge exists between the 2 nodes. Also note a weight of 0 between any
node to itself.
</p>
The adjacency Matrix for the above example would thus be:
<pre>
City #         0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
--------------------------------------------
0 Pendeleton   0   oo  oo  4   oo  oo  oo  8
1 Pensicola    oo  0   oo  5   oo  oo  oo  oo
2 Peoria       oo  oo  0   oo  oo  5   oo  3
3 Phoenix      oo  oo  4   0   oo  10  oo  3
4 Pierre       2   oo  oo  oo  0   oo  oo  oo
5 Pittsburgh   oo  4   oo  oo  oo  0   oo  oo
6 Princeton    oo  oo  oo  oo  oo  2   0   oo
7 Pueblo       oo  oo  oo  oo  3   oo  oo  0
</pre>

<h3>Filling an adjacency Matrix from an input file</h3>
<p>
Your 1st assignment will require you to read a text file <i>graph.txt</i> into a
matrix that represents the adjacency matrix of a graph. The adjacency
matrix input file for lab 1 looks like this: This format is called 'sparse'
format - since it only list values for existing edges. Here&nbsp; are the
contents of <i>graph.txt </i>which you will use in Lab2.
</p>
<pre>
8
0 1 10
0 6 2
1 2 31
2 1 22
3 5 11
4 0 9
4 1 56
4 3 13
5 2 25
5 6 15
6 1 6
6 7 22
7 0 12
7 5 1
</pre>
<p>
The first number in the file represents how many nodes the graph has. The remaining
lines are triplets of the form (source-node, dest-node, edge-weight).
In the above input file, the second line of the file reads as follows:
<pre>0 1 10
There is an edge from node 0 to node 1 and the weight of the edge is 10.</pre>
The third line of input reads as follows:
<pre>0 6 2
There is an edge from node 0 to node 6 and the weight of the edge is 2.</pre>
and so on for every remaining triplet line in the input file.
<p>
From this input file is obvious what is to be done. We must dimension a
8 x 8 matrix and for every triplet (source, dest, weight ) we read in,&nbsp; we
will&nbsp; store<pre>
G[source][dest] = weight  // where G is some 2D array indexed with [][] braces
</pre>
<p>
<hr><h2>Properties of directed graphs</h2>
<p>A nodes of a directed graph has certain properties as a result of it's edges having
<i><b>direction</b></i>. For a directed graph, we can define the following
terms:
<ul>
  <li>out-degree - the number of edges <i>leaving</i> the vertex
  <li>in-degree - the number of edges <i>entering</i> the vertex
  <li>degree - the number of edges <i>entering and leaving</i> the vertex</li>
</ul>
Your lab1 assignment will be to write a graph class to containing a 2D array to
store the connection data and to implement amoung others) the above 3&nbsp; member
methods. After doing so and testing your implementation, you are to implement
the <b>following</b> client functions in the Lab1.java (driver) file to exercise
the 3 above member functions:
<ul>
  <li>Max Out Degree - the maximal number of edges leaving any single vertex
  <li>Min Out Degree - the minimal number of edges leaving any single vertex
  <li>Max In Degree - the maximal number of edges entering any single vertex
  <li>Min In Degree - the minimal number of edges entering any single vertex
  <li>Max Degree - the maximal number of edges entering/leaving any single
    vertex
  <li>Min Degree - the minimal number of edges entering/leaving any single
    vertex</li>
</ul>
For the input file graph.txt --&nbsp; the correct answers are
<ul>
  <li>Max Out Degree - 3
  <li>Min Out Degree - 1
  <li>Max In Degree - 4
  <li>Min In Degree - 0
  <li>Max Degree - 5
  <li>Min Degree - 2</li>
</ul>

<h3>
In class exercise: <font size="2">( I'll ask for help from you then draw the
answer on the big screen)</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Draw and fill in the 2D array that represents the above graph file (sparse format).
	<li>Describe an algorithm for computing the in-degree, out-degree and degree
      of a given node
	<li>Describe an algorithm for computing the min and max&nbsp; in/out/degree
      of the graph?
</ul>

Concepts Review:</h3>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="Matrices.txt">2D array of int</a> a.k.a. <i><b>the Matrix</b></i>
</ul>
<h3>
New application of 2D arrays: A Graph Class</h3>
We want to write a Graph class to represent a graph&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>What are the data members of a Graph class?
		<ul>
			<li>a Matrix of ints representing cost/weight for that edge
			<li>Counters for how many edges etc.
		</ul>
	<li>What should the Constructor do?
	   <ul>
	   		<li>Initialize the number of roaws and columns
	   		<li>Initialize each element to the NO_EDGE value (use some constant)
	   </ul>
	<li>What other methods are need to represent our graph concept?
		<ul>
			<li>addEdge( scr, dest, weight) // puts a weight value there
			<li>removeEdge( src, dest ) // pit a NO_EDGE val there
  			<li>hasEdge( src, dest ) // T/F is there an edge here ?
			<li>readEdgeFile( fileName )  // read in a sparse format graph input file
			<li>print() // dumps a 2x2 text table (Matrix) of the edges
			<li>others ?
		</ul>
</ul>
