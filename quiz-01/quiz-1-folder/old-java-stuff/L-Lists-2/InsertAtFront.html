<h1>Intro to Linked Lists</h1>
<hr color = "green">
<p>We introduce a simple ListElement class and then build a LinkedList class on
top of it. :
</p>
<table bgcolor="white"><tr><td>
<pre><b>// This ListElement type is used by Stack, Queue and Priority Queue</b>
public class ListElement
{
  private int data;
  private ListElement next;
  
  public ListElement( int data, ListElement next)

     setData( data); 
     setNext( next ); 
  }
  public void setData(  int data )
  {
     this.data = data; // this.data is the member field, data is the incoming arg
  }
  public int getData()
  {
     return data; // no need to put &quot;this.&quot; in front of data since there is no other 'data' in here
  }
  public void setNext(  ListElement next )
  {
     this.next = next; // this.next is the member field, next is the incoming
  }
  public ListElement getNext()
  {
     return next; // no need to put &quot;this.&quot; in front of next since there is no other 'next' in here
  }
}//EOF</pre>

<h2>1st Linked List Operation: insertAtFront( int Data )</h2>

Assume we have a LinkedList class that uses the above ListElement class.&nbsp; We
recently learned how easy it is to
add elements to the list if we keep it simple by always inserting the latest element to the front of the list.
<p>This methods is our <b>insertAtFront </b>method</p>
<table bgcolor="white"><tr><td>
<pre>public class LinkedList
{
   private ListElement head;  // pointer to a list of elements
   
   public LinkedList()
   {
     head=null;
   }

   insertAtFront( int data )
   {
   		head = new ListElement( data, head );   		
   }
}//EOF</pre>
</td></tr></table>
Let's illustrate the insert at head method by starting out assuming a null head pointer in our class

<pre>
 head
[null]
</pre>
Now let's make a call to<b> insertAtHead( 7 );</b>
<p>
we will trace the effect of the assignment statement from right to left</a>
<pre>
head = new ListElement( 7, head);
</pre>
The righthand side causes the following:
<pre>
             [7,null]    a list element is created in memory having the value 7 
                         and the value null ( since head is null)
</pre>
now trace the left hand side of the assignment<pre>
  head
  [  ]-----&gt; [7,null]   head now points to the new element because the <b>new</b> keyword
                        produced the new element's address, which gets copied into head
</pre>
What makes this piece of code work is that assignments operate right to left.  Thus.. we copy 
the value of head (null) into the new element's next field <b>before</b> we copy the new element's 
address into head.
<p>
Now let's insert one more element into the list and trace it's effect graphically again<p>
insertAtFront( 33 );&nbsp;&nbsp; // which executes the <b>assignment statement:</b>&nbsp;
<i>head = new ListElement( data, head );</i><p>trace the effect of the right
hand side of the assignment
statement:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>new ListElement( data, head );</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<pre>
     [33, ]----&gt; [7,null]    a list element is created in memory having the value 33 
                             and the address of the element containing 7 
                            (since head had 7's address)
</pre>
now trace the left hand side of the assignment:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> head
=&nbsp;</i>
<pre>
    head
    [  ]-----&gt; [33, ]----&gt; [7,null]    head now points to the new element because 
                                        the new keyword produced the new elemen'ts address 
                                        which gets copied into head
</pre>


<p>Again.. what makes this piece of code work is that assignments operate right to left.  Thus.. we copy 
the value of head <i>(this time pointing to [7,null])</i> into the new element's next field <b>before</b> we copy the new element's 
address into head.</p>
