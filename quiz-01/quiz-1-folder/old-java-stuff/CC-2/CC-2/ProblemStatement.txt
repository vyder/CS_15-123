You are given an input file which consists of several lines. 
Each line begins with the name of a Political Action Commitee 
(PAC) follow by a list of people's names who belong to that group.

You must tokenize each line as follows: Each line creates one entry into a HashMap. 
The key is the PAC name, the associated value is a HashSet containing all 
the people's names on the remainder of the line.

After parsing the PAC name, and creating a HashSet of the names on the rest of the line, 
put an entry into the HashMap that is < String, HashSet > where the string is the PACname and the 
HashSet is all the names on the rest of the line. After building the HashMap you must print it out in 
sorted order by keys. The names in that PAC need not be sorted though. 

Next step is to read a file consisting of several lines. Each line will have 2 PAC group names on it.  
As you read each line you must generate the intersection of the two PACs. 
The intersection being all the people names in common to both PACs.  
The easiest way to do this is to parse the 2 PAC names from the line then declare 2 HashSets. 

Using the PACnames as keys, lookup the associated names and copy then into the 2 HashSets. 
Then simply compute the intersection using the .retainAll() method of the HashSet class. 

Then print that intersection.
