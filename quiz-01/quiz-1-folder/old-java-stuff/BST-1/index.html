<B>The Binary Tree ADT (Abstract Data Type ) </B><P>

A <EM>tree</EM>  differs from lists, stacks and queues in that it is non linear.
Trees are <EM>hierarchical</EM>  and intrinsically <i>recursive</i> data structures.<P>A
tree is hierarchical in the sense that nodes above are ancestors and nodes below
are descendants. Trees thus resemble a family hierarchy.&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li>The topmost node is called <b>root</b>
	<li>Nodes below other nodes are <b>descendents </b>of the nodes above them.
	<li>The nodes above are <b>ancestors</b> to the nodes below
	<li>Nodes <i>directly</i> below a node are <b>children </b>of the node
	<li>The node <i>directly</i> above a child is its <b>parent</b>
	<li>Nodes (other than root) having children are <b>interior </b>nodes
	<li>Nodes with no children are <b>leaves</b>
	<li>Nodes sharing the same parent are <b>siblings</b>
   <li>A parent can have multiple children
   <li>A child has exactly one parent
</ul>

<H4>Applications of the Tree ADT</H4>

The file system on your PC's hard drive is a classic example of a tree structure. Directories represent roots and the files in them
represent children.

<P>
Despite the hierarchical order of the <STRONG>structure</STRONG> of
the tree, the order enforced on objects in the tree will depend on
<STRONG>how we use the tree</STRONG>.  This just means that unlike
a <EM>stack</EM> whose operations are usually limited to <EM>push</EM>
and <EM>pop</EM>, there are many different kinds of trees and ways
to use them.  Thus, this flexibility makes them more akin to linked
lists.

<P>
Another reason to use a tree is because trees make some operations more
efficient (we'll discuss that at some later time).

<H4>Trees are intrinsically Recursive&nbsp;</H4>

Trees are defined in terms of themselves. Every node under the root is itself a
tree (or sub-tree).

<H4>Binary Search Trees (BSTs)</H4>

Binary Trees are just trees having the characteristic that no node has more than
2 children.&nbsp; We typically refer to those children as RIGHT and LEFT.&nbsp;
<p>BSTs also have the property that for every node in the tree, its left child
is less in the ordering relation that it's parent, and the right child is
greater than it's parent.</p>


<P>
<LI>
<B>a few BST Tree operations:</B>
<ul>
	<li>insert - adds a new element into the tree in it's proper position such that ordering is preserved
	<li>search - identical to insert except the operation merely stops when the node is reached - no element is inserted
	<li>remove - removes an element from the tree and preserves ordering
	<li>numNodes - counts the number of nodes on the tree including the root
	<li>numLeaves - counts only the leaves
	<li>numInteriorNodes - counts only interior nodes
	<li>traversals - typically 3 operations inOrder, preOrder, and postOrder
</ul>
<P>
<LI>
<B>Other BST Tree terms:</B>
<ul>
	<li>Full BST - Every leaf has same depth and every non-leaf has 2 children
	<li>Complete BST - Same as full BST except at the deepest level where some
		nodes may missing on the right side of the last row.
</ul>
