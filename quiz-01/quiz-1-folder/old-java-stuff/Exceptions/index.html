Exceptions are events triggered by the Java runtime when an error occurs in your program.
The Java runtime is always monitoring the execution of your program and is able to detect
error conditions such as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>trying to call <i><b>Integer.parseInt( "fubar" );</b></i> (parseInt can't convert "fubar" to an int)
	<li>trying to open a disk file that is not there: <i><b>FileReader = new
      FileReader( "non_existent_file.txt" );</b></i>
	<li>trying to declare or index an array with a bad index:   <i><b>int arr = new int[ -1 ];</b></i>
	<li>trying to allocate more memory than is available: <i><b>int arr = new int[ 999999999 ];</b></i>
</ul>

<h3>un-checked exceptions</h3>
<p>
If the programmer does not use the try/catch mechanism to handle exceptions herself, the runtime will react as follows when it
detects an <b>Exception</b> condition. Execution stops right at the exception expression and control immediately returns control
to the method that called the method where the exception occurred. If that calling method is not handling the exception,
then control keeps going back up the call chain until either some method handles the exception or until control finally returns
to the command line to the environment that invoked the program.
</p>
<p>The following demo illustrates an un-checked exception. An un-checked exception need not be caught or thrown. We will
see soon what it means for an exception to need to be caught or thrown
</p>

<h4>Output of the above program</h4>
<p>
Notice that neither main(), foo1() or foo2() completes. As soon as the exception triggers, control returns
from foo2() to foo1(). As soon as control returned to foo1() at the call to foo2(), the runtime saw that
foo1() was not handline the exception either. Control then returned to main() at the call to foo1(). Again,
main() was not handling the exception either so control returned to main's caller - the command line.

If we remove the <b>throws IOException</b> from the above program and recomplie it, the compiler will give the following errors.
</p>

<table bgcolor='black'><tr><td><pre><font color='white' size="+2" face="Courier New">
C:\Temp\ExceptionsDemo2.java:25: unreported exception java.io.FileNotFoundException;

                                ^
C:\TempExceptionsDemo2.java:28: unreported exception java.io.IOException;
	must be caught or declared to be thrown

                                    ^
2 errors
</font></pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Note the compiler cites 2 methods  <b>FileReader()</b> C'Tor and <b>readLine()</b> that require the programmer
to either catch them or declare them to be thrown. In the working version of the above program, we declared them to be
thrown by putting the throws IOException after the enclosing method's signature.

<p>
The Exception was triggered in foo2() and control immediately returned to foo1(). Since foo1() was not
handling the exception control returned to main() where foo1() was called. Since the call to foo(1() was
enclosed in a try block, control did not return to the command line. Instead, control jumped into the catch block.
The catch block looks a lot like a method body and behaves similarly. Notice that the print statement right after
the call to foo1() never executes. That's because whenever an Exception is triggered in a try block, no further code
is executed in the try block. Control jumps immediately to the catch block just as if that catch block is a method
called by the runtime. In fact, the runtime passes a parameter to that catch block. It passes the exception object
into he catch. Once inside the catch, we print out the exception info via the Exception object's toString().
</p>
<p>
There is one important difference between how this catch behaves and how a normal method behaves. Once we reach the
bottom of the catch block, we drop through and execute the next statement in main
below the catch. Unlike a method call,
we do NOT return to the call site to execute the next line of the try block.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Stacking catch blocks</h2>

<p>Often there are multiple statements in a try blocks that could throw an Exception. We could handle it several ways.
The most shotgun approach would be to have one catch block looking for Exception (the general case) that will catch any
sub-type Exception that occurs.  Usually we want to know which specific type of Exception
occurred and handle it distinctly.
To do so we stack multiple catch blocks under the single try block. Each block should test for its
specific Exception
type such as NumberFormat or IOException etc. As a catch all, it is customary to put a plain Exceptions catch at the bottom
just in case we get an unexpected unchecked exception. It is important to put the
catch all Exception at the bottom,
other wise the compiler will see you are catching the general before the specific and will give you a compilation error.
