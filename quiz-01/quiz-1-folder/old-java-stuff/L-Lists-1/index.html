<h2>Self referential structures</h2>
<ul>

	<p>
	The next data structure we explore is the linked list. A linked list is said to be a <b>self-referencing
	or self-referential</b> data structure. Contrast this with the array type. Arrays are homogenious values
	stored contiguously. As result of these 2 properties, an array is indexable. The expression array[i]
	produces a reference to the it'h element of the array in constant time simply by adding <b>arr + index *
	(# of bytes per element)</b>.
	Recall that the name of an array (its ref variable) is the address of the first element.
	</p>

	<p>
	A linked list's elements are <b>not stored contiguously</b>. Instead, each element contains a reference to the next
	element in the sequence. Another difference between array and linked list is that arrays are dimensioned all at once
	whereas linked lists are allocated incrementally. We add elements to a list only as we encounter the need to store
	another data value in the list.  To traverse a linked list we must always start at the front of the list and step
	one element at a time to reach the next elements.
	</p>

	<h4>Let's compare and contrast the Array and the Linked list in terms of time and space.</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Which data structure (array or list) gives faster access to the i'th element in the sequence?
		<li>What is the <b>big-O</b> cost of individual element access for lists vs arrays ?
		<li>Which data structure is most/least likely to waste space when allocating storage for elements?
		<li>Why?
		<li>Why can't we index to a list element?
	</ul>

	<h4>Defining a ListElement class</h4>

	Linked lists consist of individual list elements - sometimes called Node or Element. Each individual element contains
	a data value and also a reference variable (often named the <b>link</b> or <b>next</b>) that points to the next element
	in the sequence. This the ordering sequence in determined by the links in each element.

	<p>The coding for a linked list must begin at the bottom. We start with the ListElement class.</p>

	<h4><a href="ListElement.java" target=external">ListElement.java</a></h4>

	<table bgcolor="cccdd"><tr><td>
<pre>
public class ListElement
{
  private Object data;
  private ListElement next;

  public ListElement()
  {
    this( null, null );
  }

  public ListElement(Object data)
  {
    this( data, null );
  }

  public ListElement(Object data, ListElement next)
  {
    setData( data );
    setNext( next );
  }

  public Object getData()
  {
    return data;
  }

  public ListElement getNext()
  {
    return next;
  }

  public void setData(Object data)
  {
     this.data = data;
  }

  public void setNext(ListElement next)
  {
    this.next = next;
  }
} //EOF
</pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>
		Note we have a full compliment of constructors, accessors and mutators and we follow the
		good practices of funneling consturction to the full consturctor and calling the setters
		from the full constructor. 	The type of data that we are storing is type Object. This means
		that we can store objects of any class type in our ListElement - we are not restricted to
		any oner type of object to store except primatives (which are not objects anyway).
		We can even mix and match types within the list - however this can be confusing.
	</p>

	<h4>Defining a LinkedList class</h4>

	<p>
	The LinkedList class manages the list. It keeps track of the front of the list via a member typically
	called list, front or head. It also contains methods to modify the list - such as searching for,
	adding or removing elements.
	</p>

	<p>Lets write the skeleton of this class together - then we can look at the finished version. The first
	member we need is a reference to the front of the list. We shall call this member <b>head</b>. The compiler
	initializes it to null whihch is what we want since initially the list is empty. Minimally we need two
	methods to test our class. We need a method to add elements to the list, and a method to print the list
	so we can see if our other method is working
	</p>

	<h4>** Intructor will start the LinkedList class definition with student participation.</h4>

	<p>Here is a skeleton of our class with just a head member and the 2 methods needed for minimal testing</p>

	<h4> <a href="LinkedList.java">LinkedList.java</a> </h4>

	<table bgcolor="cccdd"><tr><td>
<pre>
public class LinkedList
{
	private ListElement head;  // pointer to the front (first) element of the list

	public LinkedList()
	{
		head = null; // compiler does this anyway. just for emphasis
	}

	//-------------------------------------------------------------

	// inserts new elem at front of list - pushing old elements back one place

	public void insertAtFront(Object data)
	{
		ListElement e = new ListElement();
		e.setData( data );
		e.setNext( head );
		head = e;
	}

	// we use toString as our print

	public String toString()
	{
		String res = new String();

		for (ListElement curr = head; curr != null; curr = curr.getNext())
		{
			res += curr.getData().toString();
			if (curr.getNext() != null)
				res += " --&gt; ";
		}
		res += "\n";

		return res;
	}
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>And now we need a LinkedList tester program that declares a list, inserts values and
	prints the list after inserting values.
	</p>

	<h4> <a href="ListTester.java">ListTester.java</a> </h4>

	<table bgcolor="cccdd"><tr><td>
<pre>
public class ListTester
{
	public static void main( String args )
	{
		LinkedList myList = new LinkedList();

		myList.insertAtFront("foo");
		myList.insertAtFront("bar");
		myList.insertAtFront("baz");
		myList.insertAtFront("bag");
		myList.insertAtFront("gorp");

	System.out.println( myList ); // invokes toString
	}
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>Note that the elems get printned in reverse order of their original insertion. The
	insert-at-front operation reverses input order. Lets look at the insertAtFront operation
	in detail with some diagrams.  The operations we must perform are as follows:

	<ol>
		<li>create a new list element
		<li>initialize it's data value and make <b>next</b> point at the first element in the list
		<li>make head point at the new list element
	</ol>

<pre><font color="maroon" size="+1"><b>
// Assume list looks like:  [head]----&gt;["foo" / null]

ListElement e = new ListElement();  // [e]----&gt; [null, null]

e.setData( "bar" ); // [e]----&gt; ["bar", null]

e.setNext( head );  // [e]----&gt; ["bar", -&gt;]----&gt;  ["foo", -&gt;]   &lt;----[head]

head = e;           // [head]----&gt; ["bar",-&gt;]----&gt; ["foo",null]
</b></font></pre>

	<p>
	Look at the insertAtFront method in the ListElement class definition again. Can you write
	that entire operation in one line of code ?
	</p>


	<h4>Answer: Yes! use the ListElement's full constructor as follows:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>head = new ListElement( data, head );</b>
	</ul>

	<p>Let's examine this single statement in detail and see what makes it work. An assignment statement evaluates
	from right to left, storing the value of the expression on the right, into the variable on the left of the = sign.
	It works because we copy head's pointer into our new elem's next field before overwriting head to point to
	the new elem. Thus our new elem points at the old front of the list and head points at the new elem.<p>

	<p>So..we can re-write our ListElement's full constructor as follows:

<pre><b><font size="+1" color="maroon">
// inserts new elem at front of list - pushing old elements back one place

public void insertAtFront(Object data)
{
	head = new ListElement( data, head );
}
</font ></pre></b>

	<p>Let's brainstorm some other member methods
	and write them together. We will re-run and test each new member individually</p>

	<ul>
		<li>public ListElement search( Object key ); // returns null or pointer to elem where data == key
		<li>public void insertAtBack( Object data ); // inserts at back of list - preserves order
		<li>public boolean isEmpty(); // returns true if list is empty
		<li>public void remove( Object key ); // removes matching elem if found
	</ul>

	<p><i>..........Write the above methods with student participation............</i></p>

	<h3>Defining an ordering realation on our list collection</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>How could I sort my list ?
		<li>What if my data type is not String ?
		<li>How can I define an ordering relation on the list data?
		<li>What tools does Java give us to do this?
	</ul>

	<p>It is the second issue that throws a monkey in the wrench. If we know that we would always be storing Strings
	it would be no big deal since we could use the isEqual() method built into all Strings for searches, and we could use
	compareTo() to determine lexical ordering.  It is often the case that the object stored in the data field is a class that
	we have written - and as yet there is no ordering relation defined on it.  If we want to be able to search and sort our
	list collection we must define the ordering relation and write a compareTo() method that orders this oject to another
	of same type passed in.  We will do so with the Comparable interface. Using the Comparable interface is the standard Java way
	to define the ordering on the collection and give all clients of the code the ability to search and sort.
	</p>

	<p>In order to do this we must have a user written class to serve as the data type in our list elements. It is in this class
	that must implement the Comparable interface and implement the required method of that interface - the compareTo() method.
	Let's look at a finished example of such class then explain it.</p>

	<h4> <a href="Comparable-List-Class/Student.java">Student.java</a> </h4>

	<P>Notice the following: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> class' name now has <b>implements Comparable</b> after it
		<li> we have written the comapreTo() method (required by the Comparable Interface)
		<li> the signature of this method is <b>public int compareTo( Object other )</b>
		<li> compareTo() orders this object in relation to another as less than, equal or greater then
	</ul>

	<p>There is one rather tricky peice of syntax in the compareTo() method. Notice the cast to Student on the
	incoming <b>other</b> parameter. Other points to the other object being passed in for comparison. The cast
	is required because the incoming <b>other</b> is prototytped as Object - not Student. The Object class does
	not have any data members like gpa or ssn or whatever. Therefore we cannot try to reference the .gpa field
	of a thing that is an Object - even though we know that's what we really passed in. Instead we must
	cast the incoming <b>other</b> as Student and then we can use the dot notation to directly access the gpa
	field for our comparison to this.gpa.  We still prototype our other as Object so that ANY class that implements
	comparable can be passed. Remember that hte Object class is the root of all classes. Via polymorhism any class
	type can be passed in to an Object parameter - but not vica versa.

	We must keep this incoming other object a generic Object type because the clients of our code are unconcerned about
	the type of object stored in the data field of the ListElement. The only thing they care about is that whatever
	the type is - it implements the Comparable interface. Therefore the ListElement class must be changed to store
	Comparable -not- Object, as the data type. As for the main program or other clients, then can sort and search
	on/for any data types they wish as long as those class types implement comparable. Likewise the LinkedList
	class must be changed to take Comparable rather than Object in its search, insert, remove etc. methods.
	</p>

	<h4>Quiz:
	<p>
		<li>If I decide that I want my list to store class type foo.  What requirements are there on the class foo
		and what other files if any(ListElement, LinkedList, ListTester ) must be modified and how ?
	</p>

	<h4>Here is the <a href="Comparable-List-Class">directory</a> of the LinkedList class that uses Comparables
	such as the Student class type.</h4>
