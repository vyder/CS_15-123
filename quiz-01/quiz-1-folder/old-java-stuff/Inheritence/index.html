<hr>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the design and use of classes plus the use
of inheritance (more on inheritance very soon).&nbsp;
<p>So we must first understand what a class is, then how to write and use
one.&nbsp; Let's start with something we already understand, then explain what a
class is by contrasting it with something we already understand.</p>
<h4>The Primitive Types:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Java comes with many built in data types.&nbsp; The types int, float, double,
char, boolean, etc., are know as the <b>primitive</b> <b>types</b>.&nbsp; One of
the distinguishing characteristics of the primitive types is that they can store
only one value at a time. When you declare a variable of a primitive type you
know that variable can only store one value of the type at a time.&nbsp; You
can't store the number 10 and the 8 at the same time in a single integer variable.</p>
<h4>Classes: User Defined Data Types&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Java language allows programmers to get around the limitations of the primitive
data types by allowing you to design you own data type.&nbsp; Java lets you write a
class definition file which describes a new data type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when you write a class, you are writing a definition of a new data type. Once you have defined a new data type by writing a class
definition, you can use that class name just as you would use the primitive type
names to declare variables, pass parameters and so forth.</p>
<p>In addition to allowing you to store multiple values in the same variable, a class definition allows us to store methods with those
variables.&nbsp; The relationship between the methods of a class and the data
(variables)&nbsp; in the class is simply that the methods operate on the&nbsp;
data.</p>
<p><b>Class Terminology:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The variables stored inside a class are sometimes called the <i>data</i>
or&nbsp;<i>fields</i> or <i>properties</i> or <i>instance variables</i>of the class. 
The term <i>instance variables</i> is often used because every time you create an object of the class 
tyoe, you get are creating a separate instance of the class. Thus every object (instance) of the class gets it's separate 
internal data variables. Thus the term <i>instance variables</i>. 
</p>
<p>
The methods stored alongside the instance variables in the object are sometimes called the 
<i>behaviors</i> of the class.

<h3>Some rules of good class design:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>data fields should be private or protected (more on protected soon).
	<li>provide a public set and/or get method if you want to give class users access to a private data field. 
	<li>typically you should provide a default constructor and a full
      constructor, although sometimes this is not practical or desirable.
	<li>re-use code by having your default constructor use the full constructor to initialize data via a call to <b>this(..)</b>
	<li>your <b>set_(..)</b> methods should be the only code that modifies your private data. 
	<li>only one constructor should call your <b>set_(..)</b> methods. Typically the full constructor.
</ul>

<table bgcolor='khaki'><tr><td><pre>/* PointTester1.java
   Tests Point2D class by exercising constructors, setters, getters and toString() methods.
*/
class PointTester1
{
   public static void main( String args[] )
   {
       Point2D p2 = new Point2D(); // test default C'tor
       p2.setX( 22 );  // test setX
       p2.setY( 7 );   // test setY
       System.out.println( &quot;p2 = &quot; + p2.getX() + &quot;, &quot; + p2.getY() ); // test getX and getY
       System.out.println( &quot;p2 = &quot; + p2 ); // test toString
       
       p2 = new Point2D( 1, 3 ); // test full C'tor (old p2 point destroyed)
       System.out.println( &quot;p2 = &quot; + p2 ); // test toString
   }

</pre></td></tr></table>

<font face="Verdana">
<p>
Note the line of code that declares a variable of type Point2D.
Notice that our default constructor was automatically called when we declared our Fraction in the 
Tester program.
</p>
<p><i>Just to make a point</i>: Copy the Point2D.java and
PointTest.java into a scratch directory and add a line of code to our 
default constructor that prints:<b>&quot;Point2D's default C'Tor just executed"</b>
 then recompile and execute the PointTest program.
</p>
<p>
You never called any such method in the tester program, <i> or did you ?</i> Yes you actually did because the name 
of that method is Point2D. You declared a variable of type Point2Dand thus <i> implicitly</i> called that method 
to initialize the innards of your new Point2D.
<p>
It is customary (and good practice) to declare all class data (instance
variables) as private or protected. The reason is that you don't 
want to allow clients of your class (programs that declare Point2D variables) to be able to directly modify the data 
of the class. Instead you want to force users of your class to go through proper channels, so to speak. 
You want them to make a method call to change the value of data in your class rather than direct access.
</p>
<h3><font face="Verdana">Terminology Review</font><font face="Verdana"></h3>
<p> Before going on it is time to state some commonly used terminology. The class definition
file we wrote is called a <b>class</b>.  The variables we declared of that class (p2) in some program
(PointTest1.java) 
are called <b>references</b>.&nbsp; The actual chunks of memory that store the data and methods of the Point2D variables
are called an <b>objects</b> of the Point2D class. The data lives in the object. Code that declares variables of the class type 
is called client code, or a client of the class. PointTester1 is a client of the Point2D class.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <b>class</b> is a description you write in a .java file that defines a new data type
	<li>A <b>reference</b> is a named variable that is a pointer to a class
		<ul>
			<li><pre>Point p; // Point is the class name, <b>p</b> is the reference variable</pre>
		</ul>
	<li>An <b>object</b> is the chunk of memory whose address is stored in p <b>(the object is where the data lives)</b>
		<ul>
			<li><pre>Point p = new Point( 22, 7 ); //  p contains the address of a newly created Point object. 
It is the object that contains the 22 and the 7 and the methods</pre>
		</ul>
	<li>The data members (fields) inside each object are often called <b>instance variables</b>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>instance variables</b> of the Point2D class are <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Code written inside a class</b> description file is called <b>class code</b>
	<li><b>Code written outside a class</b> description file <b> that uses that class</b> is called <b>client code</b>
	<li>PointTest1.java (it's main method) is a <b>client</b> of the Point2D class because it
      <b> declares and uses objects</b> of the <b> Point2D class</b>.
</ul>

<h2>Inheritence</h2>

<p>
Inheritence is one of OOP's more important features. Inheritence is code re-use plus a lot more. 
Inheritence is accomplished using the keyword <b>extends</b>.  When a class extends another class the 
new class is said ot be a child of the class it extends, and that original clas is said to be the parent 
of the extended class.
</p>
<p>Suppose we want to write a class that describes a point in 3D space. We could wrtie a class from scratch 
that has an x,y and z coordinate. With inheritence we don;t have to to. Instead we define a Point3D clas as 
extending the already exisiting Point2D class.  By doing so the Point3D clas inherits everything the Point2D 
class has (except it's constructors).
</p>

<table bgcolor='khaki'><tr><td><pre>
class Point3D extends Point2D
{
	// NOTHING INSIDE! EMPTY!
}
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Notice above that the Point3D class has the words <b><i>extends Point2D</i></b> after it's class name in it's 
class descriptor file.<p/>
<ul>
	<li>Point3D <b> IS-A</b> Point2D thing.
	<li>Point3D inherits all of Point2D's instance variables (x and y) and all of Point2D's methods <b>except it's constructors.</b>
</ul>

<p>
Just to prove the point (no pun intended) let's write a test progam that declares a Point3D object and then let's see if that 
Point3D object has inherited Point2D's members.&nbsp;<br>
Then put Point2D.java, Point3D.java and PointTester2.java in the same directory
and compile &amp; run the Tester.
</p>

<table bgcolor='khaki'><tr><td><pre>/* PointTester2.java
   Tests bare-bones Point3D class by exercising default C'tor (not inherited), 
   setters, getters and toString() methods.
*/
class PointTester2
{
   public static void main( String args[] )
   {
       Point3D p3 = new Point3D(); // test default C'tor  NOT inherited from 2D
       p3.setX( 22 );  // test setX
       p3.setY( 7 );   // test setY
       System.out.println( &quot;p3 = &quot; + p3.getX() + &quot;, &quot; + p3.getY() ); // test getX, getY
       System.out.println( &quot;p3 = &quot; + p3 ); // test toString            
   }
} // EOF
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
The result is proof that by extending a class, the child class inherits  everything from it's parent except it's constructors. 
One more thing before we go on. Just to prove that the constructors are not inherited, try to construct a Point3D object passing in 2
args.
</p>

<p>The above Point3D class proves that the keyword <b>extends</b> indeed causes
the child class (Point3D)&nbsp; to inherit the members of its parent class
(Point2D).&nbsp; However, this bare-bones example does not demonstrate the
usefulness of inheritance.&nbsp; Inheritance becomes useful when we either add
new members to the child class, and or override existing members of the
parent.
</p>
<h4> A slightly more useful example of inheritance</h4>

<table bgcolor='khaki'><tr><td><pre>class Point3D extends Point2D
{
   private int z; // we just added a new member 

   public Point3D() // def C'Tor
   {
	  this( 0, 0 , 0 ); // call upon our Full C'tor to do the job
   }

   // Full C'Tor calls upon parent Full C'tor to init x,y
   // this is good code reuse - the parent knows how to init x and y 
   // never re-write tried and true logic! 
   // But we init z ourselves since parent does not know about z
   public Point3D( int x, int y, int z ) // full C'Tor
   {
	  super( x, y ); // super means call parent's C'Tor (2 arg ver)
	  setZ( z );
   }

   public int getZ()
   {
	  return z;
   }
   public void setZ( int z )
   {
	  this.z = z;
   }

   // we OVERRIDE our parent's definition of toString since it cannot serve
   // our purpose in its form 

   // Notice in this toString code we reference x and y directly. It works 
   // because our parent declared them protected rather than private. If
   // parent had made them private, we would have to call getX and getY just
   // any other client code out in main. The keyword protected sort of 
   // keeps members &quot;in the family&quot;
    
   public String toString()
   {
     return &quot;(&quot; + x + &quot;,&quot; + y + &quot;,&quot; + z + &quot;)&quot;;  
   }
}</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Notice the keyword <b>super</b> in the Full C'tor of Point3D. This keyword is used to 
call the parent C'Tor. Specifically the parent C'tor that takes 2 int args. This is desirable 
because the parent knows about x and y and knows how they are to be initialized. We don't want to 
rewrite tried and true logic that has been inherited from our parent. Instead we take
advantage of it 
(code re-use principle again!).  Notice also that we follow our good rules of class design by having our
default C'Tor call on the full C'Tor and having the full C'Tor be the only code that calls the setters.
Note also that only our setters ever modify our data members.
</p>
<h5>
One last observation. Be sure you noticed the obvious. We did not write setters or
getters for x and y because we inherited those&nbsp; from our parent.
</h5>
<h4>A third point tester program</h4>

<table bgcolor='khaki'><tr><td><pre>/* PointTester3.java
*/
class PointTester3
{
   public static void main( String args[] )
   {
       Point3D p3 = new Point3D(); // test default C'tor  NOT inherited from 2D
       p3.setX( 22 );  // test setX
       p3.setY( 7 );   // test setY
       System.out.println( &quot;p3 = &quot; + p3.getX() + &quot;, &quot; + p3.getY() ); // test getX, getY
       System.out.println( &quot;p3 = &quot; + p3 ); // test toString    
       
       Point2D p2;
       p2 = p3;  // LOOKS WRONG BUT IT's ACTUALLY A_OK
       System.out.println( &quot;p3 = &quot; + p3 ); // p2 points to the 3D object        
   }
} // EOF
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Note in the above test program we assigned a child type reference into a parent type reference. 
This is a preview of <i>polymorphism</i>. Simply put, a parent reference can point to one it's chilren's 
objects but NOT visa versa.  We will see very soon that this fact allows us to design objects in 
a very generic manner.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
<p>Inheritance has more advantages than just code re-use.&nbsp; Inheritance
allows binding of overwritten methods to be resolved dynamically at run-time.</p>

	{
		A a[] = { new A(), new B(), new C() };

		a[i].print();
	}

<p><font face="Verdana">You may be looking at the above example and wondering &quot;Why do we need
polymorphism? &quot; After all you could have just declared 3 totally unrelated
classes, given them all print method and then invoked the print of each
class.&nbsp; The convenience of Polymorphism is that all the classes share the
is-a relationship to the base class. As such we can declare an array of these
classes. Note, you can't declare an array of different types. Thus every element
in the array is-a Type A object. It is not until it is referenced at runtime
that the object is distinguished to be an A ,B or C object and the proper print
method resolved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The advantages are numerous. You can pass a reference to any of the types
into a method expecting the base type.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">The Object Class</font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana">The Object class is the ancestor of all classes in Java. Every class in Java
or every class you write, it is as if you wrote <b>extends Object </b>after
every class prototype.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Since all classes descend from Object, there are a few notable methods that
all classes inherit from Object. The first two inherited methods need to be overwritten
by your class definition if they are to have any functionality. The last one is implemented generically</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana">public boolean equals( Object o)</font>
	<li><font face="Verdana">public String toString()</font>
	<li><font face="Verdana">public final native Class getClass()</font>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">To overwrite equals and toString you simple write our
own version of those those two methods in your class. definition.</font></p>
<h2><font face="Verdana">Abstract Classes</font></h2>
<p><font face="Verdana">Often a class is designed with the expectation that it only make sense to use
this class to derive extended classes from but to instantiate classes directly
from this type. Typically this base class characterizes behavior that derived
classes will implement in their own special way.&nbsp; A <b>Shape</b> class
could describe behavior for various different kinds of shapes, and each derived
class such as <b>Circle,</b> <b>Square </b>and <b>Rectangle</b> would provide specific
different methods to implement the behaviors.&nbsp;</font></p>

Notice now that our abstract class also has abstract methods declared inside. This means that any class 
designer than derives from Shape must also override area() and perimeter().  Not every abstract class

<h2><font face="Verdana">Interfaces</font></h2>

way to inherite the interface from more than one parent.</font></p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h4><font face="Verdana">A typical class definition follows these rules:&nbsp;</font></h4>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana">contained in a file of same name as the class but with ".java" added</font>
   <li><font face="Verdana">has 1 or more private data fields</font>
   <li><font face="Verdana">has 1 or more public constructors to initialize objects of the class</font>
   <li><font face="Verdana">has a copy constructor to allow initialization to a value of another object of the type</font>
   <li><font face="Verdana">has a set and get method for each private field</font>
   <li><font face="Verdana">has a toString method for convenient print of the object state</font>
</ul>

<h4><font face="Verdana">Once a class definition file has been written - the class name represents a new data type.</font></h4>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana">the class name becomes another data type name and objects (variables) of the class type can be declared just like with other data types</font>
	<li><font face="Verdana">the <b>new</b> keyword must be used to call the object's constructor</font>
	<li><font face="Verdana">more than 1 object of the class type may be declared - just like with other data types</font>
   <li><font face="Verdana">each object constructed gets its own copy of the fields and methods</font>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana">Classes can inherit from classes via the keyword extend<br>
Classes can declare member in 1 or 4 access modes: public, private, protected,
package<br>
Inheritance enables polymorphism which is runtime binding of reference to
overridden methods<br>
Java supports interfaces to effect multiple inheritance</font></p>
